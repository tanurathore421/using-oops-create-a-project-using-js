switch --> if we have a number of cases like week ,month ,year  then we are switch .

switch(expression)
{
	case case_nu:    statement ;
			break;
	case case_nu:    statement ;

1. The Basic Level: Day of the Week
The Task: Create a variable called dayNumber (1-7). Write a switch case that prints the name of the day.

Input: 1 → Output: "Monday"

Input: 5 → Output: "Friday"

Default: "Invalid day"

2. The Conditional Logic: Grade Evaluator
The Task: Write a program that takes a single letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) and returns a description.

'A': "Excellent work!"

'B': "Well done!"

'C': "You passed."

'F': "Better luck next time."

Default: "Unknown grade."

3. The Calculator: Simple Math
The Task: Create a simple calculator. You need three variables: num1, num2, and operator (+, -, *, /). Use a switch case on the operator to perform the correct math.

Input: 5, 10, "+" → Output: 15

Input: 20, 4, "/" → Output: 5

4. The "Fall-Through" Challenge: Seasons
The Task: Group multiple cases together. Given a month number (1-12), output which season it belongs to.
